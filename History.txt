version 1	15 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		19 minutes total

Notes v1: I went for a basic version. Definitely not a finished product, but not bad! Surprising,
positive for a first attempt. Don't get me wrong: lots of follow up TODOs exist.


version 2 	14 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	3 minutes test		37 minutes total

Notes v2: it is early. Try to fix ALL the prior issue. The odds are low. But hey, why take time? If
you can fix 8 issues and create 2 new ones, that would be great.
Result: it was a lot better! OK, I ended up skipping a couple, but I fixed six of them. Some changes
were great, some are... merely good, need tweaks, but better. Some things remain for sure, but 
this is borderline playable as-is.


version 3	8 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	1 minute test		48 minutes total

Notes v3: switched to just one change - the more refined acceleration. The first build was MASSIVELY
different. It went to very simple graphic. Very abstract; definitely worse. I asked it to build it
directly with v2 as a basis, just the acceleration change. It did it well - the changes were 
fairly small; all changes seemed directed toward the acceleration.


version 4	20 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	4 minutes test		1 hour 14 total

Notes v4: try to have move compact action screen. It is better, to an extent. The are close, and 
they take less space. Nad I give them credit - the line changes were very minor to this (3 lines
of code). But that are moved too far north (I do not want Player 1 shown over trees)
and as a percentage, the bottom screen has too much useless. Would work better, really, just 
dropping both team down quite a bit.


version 5	4 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		1 hour 22 total

Notes v5: after the v4 version, looking at the diff, it was very easy to see how to tweak the UI
spacing. I did that - it was quick, easy, and I now have what I wanted.


version 6	8 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	1 minutes test		1 hour 33 total

Notes v6: removed some UI elements. Got rid of direction and details on how game is played. Got
rid of notes on how to restart. Quick and easy.


version 7	16 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		1 hour 54

Notes v7: the weird appearances of 2 different Santas on each vehicle was annoying. Further,
it was annoying I liked the location of 1 Santa (inside the car) and the depiction of the
other (on the line). This two steps. First, I removed the Santa inside the car. Next, I
placed the other Santa into the car. Took some time, but pretty easy. Required a one-line
manual change to tweak the vertical placement in the car. Very happy! Next will be adding the
set-go lights to start the race. I'm nervous!


version 8	21 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	3 minutes test		2 hours 19

Notes v8: this is the first version I view as the complete game. It took some time to provide
the description for the red and green light, how long to turn from red to green, and the rules
around starting when red. But it passed, first try! There was a cosmetic fix: the Santa in the
car switched back to the original I did not like. Referring the prior version, and easy fix.
Going forward, I think we will be look at UI. I don't see any functional changes.


version 9	8 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	2 minutes test		2 hours 30

Notes v9: increased the size of the lights and moved it more to the center. The first attempt
worked! The initial code from Chat did some code formatting changes and comments. I just took 
the updated function for the light rendering (drawTrafficLight) and replaced only that.
I'd say this is the first version that is truly releasable for others to play. I want to
change the title UI up-top... and I think that will be it! At least, for a first version for
others to play with.


version 10	10 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	4 minutes test		2 hours 45

Notes v10: two changes. One, I changed the title up-top. Chat create something more involved.
Switched to Impact font (my choice) as initial change. It added a metallic look, by changing 
colors down the line. I added some color adjustments to make the color ting green. Two, I 
removed the lines toward the bottom the identify the players with a text description. Easy 
removal; it provided little value while taking some space. 
Not sure what changes are needed next!


version 11	12 minutes dev	0 minutes code gen	3 minutes test		3 hours 0

Notes v11: after the holidays, going for some basic changes. Today, it's fixing the finish
line. It's too tall/long, and goes over the trees. It needs to just go over standard snow.
I asked Chat where that skinny line drawing was defined. It did that correctly. I tried
it manually. It took 3 times to get it where I liked. Zero code builds needed - tweaked
HTML, and reloaded page. After that, moved over to the checkered flag pattern to its right.
I didn't need chat to find that code: it was directly after the line. I changed that after a
couple of trials. Finally, there was the FINISH text on that line. Again, no Chat needed: that
was directly after the checkered flag. I moved it down. I moved it over a hair to the right, 
and I lightened the color to make it appear more clearly on black and white flag.


version 12	2 minutes dev	0 minutes code gen	1 minute test		3 hours 3

Notes v12: the color between the snow (RBG: F4F8FF) and the Santa clothing edges (FFFFFF)
was very similar. It made it difficult to see hat tips against that snow. I went to
darken the snow a touch, keeping it slightly blue, to add contrast and keep snow looking
normal. I changed the snow slightly to F0F4FF. Nice mix - snow looks quite white; there  
is sufficient contract with the hat tip. While I was looking at code, I noticed that
the sky leaned green. Looked OK, but maybe a bit odd. Changed the sky to blue - made it
darker than before, to better contrast it with the snow.


version 14	24 minutes dev	0 minutes code gen	7 minutes test		3 hours 34

Notes v14: added the display of Santa's velocities. Started with a way to layout the names 
on the top of the screen. Moved the 2nd player to the middle of the screen to make sure that
there is plenty of space for both. Next, asked Chat how to add a speed to the UI. It asked how
I wanted to calculate the speed. Truly, there is no precision needed: something between 
100-200 mph would look fine. It started by multiplying each players velocity by 10. That actually
WAS pretty good as-is. The only thing is since it is by 10, all speeds are evenly divisible by 10.
I changed it to 7. A little slower, but still fast (speeds end around 150-ish) and not easy to
see the pattern (it's there if you want but not easy). I tried to further tweak by adding a 
small random number to make it look even more "real". There were multiple issues. I had to 
"freeze" that random number at the beginning and end of the match. And the jumpiness didn't help 
that much. Ended with the easy multiply by 7. After that, the layout of the names was OK, but 
difficult to see both of their speeds. Instead of side-by-side, went one player's data of top 
the other. Not perfect (numbers do not line up vertically) but better.


version 15	13 minutes dev	0 minutes code gen	6 minutes test		3 hours 53

Notes v15: moved from 20 to 40 frames per second. I am VERY happy with how this looks. It is
the difference maker: looks very smooth now. The basis was change of MS per move from 50 to 25. 
To adjust for more frequent moves, dropped the increment on velocity in half. Finally,
increased the "MPH calculation" to double. This works well. Since this change was made, I
doubled the rate of acceleration checks. Went from checking every 200ms to 100ms. Increment
in velocity got halved AGAIN. Finally, I used Math.floor() on the display speed, since you
can get decimal values here. Average speeds in the races remain the same, with smoothness for
both accelerations and animation.

 
MAYBE Sound effect on start/finish
MAYBE Add visual snow/confetti when someone wins
MAYBE ties aren't QUITE right. It appear if they cross the finish in the same frame, it is a tie
	even if one them was ahead. MAYBE fix it? It's good as-is.
MAYBE ChatGPT said "Make reindeer sprites more detailed or add simple animation for their legs."
MAYBE ChatGPT said "A stronger chrome look"
MAYBE ChatGPT said "A checker-flag stroke"
MAYBE ChatGPT said "Or motion blur / speed slant"
