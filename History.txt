version 1	15 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		19 minutes total

Notes v1: I went for a basic version. Definitely not a finished product, but not bad! Surprising,
positive for a first attempt. Don't get me wrong: lots of follow up TODOs exist.


version 2 	14 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	3 minutes test		37 minutes total

Notes v2: it is early. Try to fix ALL the prior issue. The odds are low. But hey, why take time? If
you can fix 8 issues and create 2 new ones, that would be great.
Result: it was a lot better! OK, I ended up skipping a couple, but I fixed six of them. Some changes
were great, some are... merely good, need tweaks, but better. Some things remain for sure, but 
this is borderline playable as-is.


version 3	8 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	1 minute test		48 minutes total

Notes v3: switched to just one change - the more refined acceleration. The first build was MASSIVELY
different. It went to very simple graphic. Very abstract; definitely worse. I asked it to build it
directly with v2 as a basis, just the acceleration change. It did it well - the changes were 
fairly small; all changes seemed directed toward the acceleration.


version 4	20 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	4 minutes test		1 hour 14 total

Notes v4: try to have move compact action screen. It is better, to an extent. The are close, and 
they take less space. Nad I give them credit - the line changes were very minor to this (3 lines
of code). But that are moved too far north (I do not want Player 1 shown over trees)
and as a percentage, the bottom screen has too much useless. Would work better, really, just 
dropping both team down quite a bit.


version 5	4 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		1 hour 22 total

Notes v5: after the v4 version, looking at the diff, it was very easy to see how to tweak the UI
spacing. I did that - it was quick, easy, and I now have what I wanted.


version 6	8 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	1 minutes test		1 hour 33 total

Notes v6: removed some UI elements. Got rid of direction and details on how game is played. Got
rid of notes on how to restart. Quick and easy.


version 7	16 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		1 hour 54

Notes v7: the weird appearances of 2 different Santas on each vehicle was annoying. Further,
it was annoying I liked the location of 1 Santa (inside the car) and the depiction of the
other (on the line). This two steps. First, I removed the Santa inside the car. Next, I
placed the other Santa into the car. Took some time, but pretty easy. Required a one-line
manual change to tweak the vertical placement in the car. Very happy! Next will be adding the
set-go lights to start the race. I'm nervous!


version 8	21 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	3 minutes test		2 hours 19

Notes v8: this is the first version I view as the complete game. It took some time to provide
the description for the red and green light, how long to turn from red to green, and the rules
around starting when red. But it passed, first try! There was a cosmetic fix: the Santa in the
car switched back to the original I did not like. Referring the prior version, and easy fix.
Going forward, I think we will be look at UI. I don't see any functional changes.


TODO Get a cooler version of the title up top. Impact is the name of the font.
TODO The red/green lights are a bit small and off-center. Could use improvement.

MAYBE Show live velocities (pixels/0.1s) next to each players name
MAYBE Sound effect on start/finish
MAYBE Add visual snow/confetti when someone wins
