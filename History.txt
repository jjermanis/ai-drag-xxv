version 1	15 minute dev	2 minute code gen	2 minute test		19 minutes total

Notes v1: I went for a basic version. Definitely not a finished product, but not bad! Surprising,
positive for a first attempt. Don't get me wrong: lots of follow up TODOs exist.


version 2 	14 minute dev	1 minute code gen	3 minute test		37 minutes total

Notes v2: it is early. Try to fix ALL the prior issue. The odds are low. But hey, why take time? If
you can fix 8 issues and create 2 new ones, that would be great.
Result: it was a lot better! OK, I ended up skipping a couple, but I fixed six of them. Some changes
were great, some are... merely good, need tweaks, but better. Some things remain for sure, but 
this is borderline playable as-is.


TODO race acceleration needs improvement. Every 0.1 seconds looks a little jumpy. Maybe every 0.05 second
looks smooth enough? Maybe frames are every 0.05 seconds, and acceleration is just 0.1 second (to keep
the speed the same).
TODO there appears to be... two Santa like characters? Just the one inside the drag.
TODO tie management needs to be better. Haven't looked at code (yet). It seems it is a draw if they cross the
finish line at the same 0.1 second interval, even if one gets their first (shows as ahead). Change to
tie if they cross at the same time AND the distance in the race is exactly the same.
TODO There should be the rule for a red/green flag to start
