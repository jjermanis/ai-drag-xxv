version 1	15 minute dev	2 minute code gen	2 minute test		19 minutes total

Notes v1: I went for a basic version. Definitely not a finished product, but not bad! Surprising,
positive for a first attempt. Don't get me wrong: lots of follow up TODOs exist.



TODO controls ask for button to be help. The controller should just be tapped, then will accelerate
for entire race
TODO trees move in a wave on the background. Haha no! The trees look fine but should sit there.
TODO racers should accelerate much more quickly. Rough estimate: 4 second races.
TODO name of players should be created and presented
TODO there appears to be... two Santa like characters? Just the one inside the drag.
TODO It should keep track of wins and losses (and ties!)
TODO It should notice when there is a tie.
TODO There should be the rule for a red/green flag to start
