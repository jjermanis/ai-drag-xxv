version 1	15 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		19 minutes total

Notes v1: I went for a basic version. Definitely not a finished product, but not bad! Surprising,
positive for a first attempt. Don't get me wrong: lots of follow up TODOs exist.


version 2 	14 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	3 minutes test		37 minutes total

Notes v2: it is early. Try to fix ALL the prior issue. The odds are low. But hey, why take time? If
you can fix 8 issues and create 2 new ones, that would be great.
Result: it was a lot better! OK, I ended up skipping a couple, but I fixed six of them. Some changes
were great, some are... merely good, need tweaks, but better. Some things remain for sure, but 
this is borderline playable as-is.


version 3	8 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	1 minute test		48 minutes total

Notes v3: switched to just one change - the more refined acceleration. The first build was MASSIVELY
different. It went to very simple graphic. Very abstract; definitely worse. I asked it to build it
directly with v2 as a basis, just the acceleration change. It did it well - the changes were 
fairly small; all changes seemed directed toward the acceleration.


version 4	20 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	4 minutes test		1 hour 14 total

Notes v4: try to have move compact action screen. It is better, to an extent. The are close, and 
they take less space. Nad I give them credit - the line changes were very minor to this (3 lines
of code). But that are moved too far north (I do not want Player 1 shown over trees)
and as a percentage, the bottom screen has too much useless. Would work better, really, just 
dropping both team down quite a bit.


version 5	4 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		1 hour 22 total

Notes v5: after the v4 version, looking at the diff, it was very easy to see how to tweak the UI
spacing. I did that - it was quick, easy, and I now have what I wanted.


TODO there appears to be... two Santa like characters? Just the one inside the drag.
TODO There should be the rule for a red/green flag to start
TODO The bottom shows details about starting the race (toward bottom of screen) show details of updates
and acceleration. Drop those numeric stats - they are not necessary; not cool.

MAYBE Show live velocities (pixels/0.1s) next to each players name
MAYBE Sound effect on start/finish
MAYBE Add visual snow/confetti when someone wins
