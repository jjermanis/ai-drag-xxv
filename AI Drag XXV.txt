Create a single-page app in a single HTML file with the following requirements:
- Name: Drag Race XXV
- Goal: get your Santa Claus (with his reindeer and drag racer) across the finish line
- the screen is primarily white, like snow. 
- There is a pine forest at the top of the screen, in the background. The pine forest does not move at all in the game.
- the top of the screen is centered and says Drag Race XXV!!!
- there are two Santa Clauses on the screen.
- there is a finish line on the right side of the screen.
- a Santa Claus is a racing Santa Claus. Starting on the right, there is a line of 8 reindeer. The are connected with
a harness line, like horses would use to connect to reach other. The reindeer face right. To the left of the reindeer is a
drag racer car. Inside the car is a Santa Claus.
- there are two players in this game. Each player has a button that starts the drag racer. They tap their button to start
racing. They do not need to hold the button - if they tap, their will continue to accelerate. Player 1 uses the letter Q.
Player 2 uses the letter P. 
- When they accelerate, they start at a velocity of 1 pixel every 0.05 seconds. Every 0.2 seconds, there is an 80% chance it gets
faster. If it gets faster, velocity increases 1 pixel more every 0.05 seconds. If it does not get faster, it stays the same
velocity.
- Each player has special colors for the harness line, the drag racer, and the Santa Claus suit. Player 1 uses a
red special color. Player 2 uses a green special color.
- Each player has a special name. Player 1 is named Swift Santa. Player 2 is named Nitro Nicolas.
- For each player, it will show their race records in this format: X-Y-Z. X is how many wins, Y is how many losses,
Z is how many ties.
- When a player's drag racer starts, it accelerates toward the right. At first, all you can see is the first deer -
everything else is not seen, to the left of the screen. The players deer and drag racer travel to the right. The first
drag racer that touches the finish line wins the race. If both players reach the finish line at the same time, it is
a tie for both of them.
